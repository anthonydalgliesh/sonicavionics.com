# Overview

This is where we'll put the stuff for the research and logistics division. The goal is that everything here such as TVC, will be transferred to the guidelines section once the project is done.

There are many aspects of MARS. Primarily our mission is to teach lower years about engineering, however our secondary goal is to expand our scope of knowledge to become better engineers ourselves. This section is for the MARS research division.
